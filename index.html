        <h2>What you need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cards</li>
            <li>Hands</li>
            <li>A spectator or audience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to perform the tricks</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Tell the spectaor(s) that you need to find a specific
                queen in the deck</li>
            <li>"Accidentally" skip the queen, and make sure to look at the 
                top card in the deck without them noticing</li>
                <li>then go back through and find the queen</li>
                <li>tell the spectator(s) that 
                you don't do anything for this trick, but the queen is the one who does the magic</li>
                <li>The queen then tells you to split
                the pile in three piles. Make sure to
                 keep track of which pile has the top card on 
                 it that you already saw</li>
                 <li>The queen then tells you to ask the 
                spectator to point to one of the piles</li>
                <li>Audience goes "WOW!"</li>
        </ol>
